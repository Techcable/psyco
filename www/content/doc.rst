Documentation
*************


Current status: Psyco is already quite usable, and I consider is as stable.


The Ultimate Psyco Guide
========================

Documentation for Psyco release 1.6:

* `Browse as on-line HTML@psycoguide/index.html`
* Download as a `gzipped Postscript@psycoguide.ps.gz` file

You can also get it by downloading all the pages of this site: `psyco-site.tar.gz` or `psyco-site.zip`.


How does it work?
=================

* `Animated slides@accu2004-psyco.tgz` from the Python UK conference at
  `ACCU 2004@http://www.accu.org/conference/`.  To see them, you will need to
  install `Pygame@http://www.pygame.org`.

* A more theoretical paper for the `PEPM'04@http://profs.sci.univr.it/~pepm04/` conference at ACM SIGPLAN 2004 can be downloaded in compressed Postscript format: `[A4]@psyco-pepm-a.ps.gz` or `[Letter]@psyco-pepm-l.ps.gz`).


IRC channel
===========

I will be lurking around the channel #psyco on irc.freenode.net if you have any question for me or want to chat with other Psyco users.


Technical documentation
=======================

* **Representation-based Just-in-time Specialization and the Psyco prototype for Python.**  Download as `compressed Postscript@theory_psyco.ps.gz` or `PDF@theory_psyco.pdf`.

There are two older technical documents which may be of interest:

* `A technical presentation@psyco.ps.gz`
* `The structure of Psyco@structure.ps.gz` (old)
