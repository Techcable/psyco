Current version is 1.4
======================

`Download Release 1.4@http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41036`.

See the documentation for how to install from `precompiled binaries@psycoguide/binaries.html` or `from sources@psycoguide/sources.html`.

Be sure to check the `requirements@psycoguide/req.html`.

Other tools
===========

Windows users who want to explore the generated machine code need `objdump.exe@http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/psyco/psyco/py-utils/win32/objdump.exe?rev=1.1&view=auto` which itself needs `cygwin1.dll@http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/psyco/psyco/py-utils/win32/cygwin1.dll?rev=1.1&view=auto`. Both are GPL software distributed (with source) in `Red Hat's Cygwin@http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/`. They should be put in the Psyco subdirectory ``py-utils\win32``.

The required tool, objdump, is generally preinstalled on Linux distributions.
